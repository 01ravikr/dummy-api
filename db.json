            "Types of franchises": "We operate with three distinct types of franchise models, each designed to serve specific operational needs and customer volumes:1. Master Franchise: A Master Franchise acts as a central processing hub for multiple Retail franchises. Once customer orders are collected by the Retail units, they are sent to the Master Franchise for all major laundry operations such as washing, dry cleaning, ironing, and packing. The cleaned items are then sent back to the respective Retail franchises for final delivery. Typically located in large Tier 1 cities with high order volumes and multiple dependent Retail units.2. Single Unit Franchise / Live Unit: A Single Unit or Live Unit Franchise operates independently. It does not have any associated Retail franchises under it. Equipped with essential laundry machinery, this unit handles the entire workflow — from receiving orders directly from runners, to cleaning, packing, and final delivery to customers. Runners collect and deliver directly between the customer and this unit. Ideal for areas with moderate demand.3. Retail Franchise: A Retail Franchise serves as the first point of contact for customer orders. Runners pick up laundry from customers and deliver it to the Retail unit. From there, the orders are forwarded to the associated Master Franchise for complete processing. Once the cleaning is done, the items are sent back to the Retail unit for final customer delivery. Suited for local presence and customer convenience, typically connected to a nearby Master Franchise.",
            "Runner": "A Runner is responsible for collecting orders from customers and delivering them to the designated retail or live unit (depending on the center type). Once the processing — including washing, dry cleaning, and packing — is completed, the Runner ensures the final delivery of the cleaned garments back to the customer. The Runner plays a crucial role in maintaining customer satisfaction by ensuring timely pickups and deliveries, and they are often the face of the brand during these interactions. Their efficiency and professionalism directly impact the overall customer experience.",
            "Workshop Hub / W_Hub": "A Workshop Hub is a central processing facility that handles the major laundry operations for multiple Retail franchises. It is responsible for washing, dry cleaning, ironing, and packing garments collected from the Retail units. The Workshop Hub ensures that all cleaning processes are carried out efficiently and to the highest quality standards. Once the cleaning is completed, the cleaned items are sent back to the respective Retail franchises for final delivery to customers. This centralized approach allows for streamlined operations and better resource management.It is typically located in large Tier 1 cities i.e at master franchise with high order volumes and multiple dependent Retail units. The Workshop Hub plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and consistency of the laundry services provided by the brand.",

Hub) – 30 (delivered) = 5 Pending Deliveries Packed but Delayed Deliveries / Pack & Delay Del: The number of orders that have been packed and are ready for delivery but have not yet reached the customer.Calculation: 40 (packed) – 30 (delivered) = 10 Packed but Delayed DeliveriesTotal Delayed Deliveries / Delayed Del Total : Represents all the orders that were initially intended for delivery, but have not yet been delivered — regardless of whether they are packed or transported.
